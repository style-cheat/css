# Style-Cheat (CSS)

Just another CSS Framework.

## Motivation

Having fun coding and learning was the key motivation to write "just another
CSS Framework".

## Description

You always wanted to cheat a bit, when developing your website?
"Style-Cheat CSS" provides the code you need. The framework is very minimal per
design to reduce loading times (only 6kb, <2kb compressed). Modularity will
allow you, to bring only the tools, you really need. Disable everything else!
Mobile First and Responsive Elements will ensure that your website fits for all
modern devices. The code is also easy to learn, so you can focus on your website
and not on the framework.

## Installation
