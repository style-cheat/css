# Style-Cheat (CSS)

Just another CSS Framework.

## Motivation

Having fun coding and learning was the key motivation to write "just another
CSS Framework".

## Description

Style-Cheat CSS is a CSS Framework written in SASS.

## Principles

**Modularity**  is the first principle of
  "Style-Cheat CSS". You can enable what you need and disable, what you
  don't like.

**Minimalism** is the second principle. "Style-Cheat CSS"
  is only x.ykb (x.ykb gzipped), including all modules. This will result
  in faster loading times of your website and a better overall performance.

**Modern** development is the third principle.
  "Style-Cheat CSS" is applying paradigms like mobile-first,
  responsive design or flexbox.

**Multi Purpose** design is the fourth principle.
  "Style-Cheat CSS" is following an approach to be usable for many and
  tunable. It can be used for blogs, personal pages, wikis or anything
  else.
